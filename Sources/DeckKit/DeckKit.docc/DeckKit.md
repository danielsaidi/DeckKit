DeckKit is a SwiftUI SDK that helps you build deck-based apps.



## Overview

![DeckKit logo](Logo.png)

DeckKit is a SwiftUI library that makes it easy to create deck-based apps on any platform. It has a ``DeckView`` that can render a list of items, with support for swipe gestures, edge swipes, shuffling, etc.

DeckKit can be customized to great extent. You can change colors, fonts, etc. and use completely custom views. It also has other views like the ``DeckPageView``, as well as tools to manage favorites.



## Installation

DeckKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:
